        <p style="font-size: 18px;">In Liver Transplant Surgery, The Patientâ€™s Old Liver Is Removed Completely And A New One From A Liver Donor Is Put In The Same Place After Joining The Blood Vessels And The Bile Duct. The Donor Liver Can Be From A Dead Person Where Usually The Whole Liver Is Transplanted Or More Commonly It Is From A Family Member Who Donates Part Of His Or Her Liver. Although We Only Have One Liver In Our Body, Liver Can Now Be Safely Divided In To 2 Parts So That One Part Can Be Taken Out For Transplantation And The Remaining Liver Is Sufficient For The Donor. Both These Portions Can Regenerate Quickly To Its Original Size Though The Shape Will Become Different. Liver Transplant Is Reserved For Those Whose Liver Disease Has Progressed So Much That Their General Condition Is Critical. Generally, These Are Patients Who Have Exhausted Other Forms Of Treatment Or Side By Side Have Developed Liver Cancer. In Cadaveric Transplant, The Wait Can Be Unpredictable And Some Patients Will Die While Waiting For A Donor Liver. On The Other Hand, Living Donor Liver Transplant Can Be Done When The Patient Really Needs It And When The Entire Team Is Available As It Is A Planned Operation.

There Are Different Causes For Liver Failure Such As Chronic Viral Infection With B And C Virus, Liver Tumor, Alcoholism, Fatty Liver, Bile Duct Abnormalities (Primary Biliary Cholangitis, Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis And Biliary Duct Atresia). Hepatitis B And C Are The Two Most Common Infections Across The World. Luckily There Is An Effective Vaccine For Hepatitis B And Cure By Drugs For Hepatitis C. Primary Liver Cancer Develops In Chronically Diseased Livers And Sometimes Develops Rapidly So That No Treatment Is Possible.
